## üìù How It Works

- **ShortenerPage:** Enter a long URL, optional validity, and optional custom shortcode. Click "Shorten" to generate a unique short URL.
- **RedirectHandler:** When a short URL is visited, the app looks up the original URL, tracks the click, and redirects (if not expired).
- **StatsPage:** View all created short URLs, their expiry, and click analytics.
- **Logger:** All major actions and errors are logged using the custom logger utility.
